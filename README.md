## Overview of Analysis 

Last summer, my friend Kate and I took the vacation of a lifetime. We spent 2 full weeks in New York City exploring historical landmarks like Central Park, the Empire State Building, and the Statue of Liberty. It was a magical experience. As we flew home we looking through photos and realized a key ingredient to the magic was an unlikely suspect, Citibike. Kate and I biked everywhere which allowed us to get to really know New York City and interact with others as they commuted on rideshare bikes.

A gem of an idea stated to form in our minds. What if we could start a similar bikeshare in Des Moines Iowa, our hometown? Kate and I start brainstorming, and a to of weeks later, Kate calls telling me she may have a potential angel investor. The potential investoris interested in providing seed money to explore a bikesharing program in Des Moines. This is an exciting prospect, but I know we have to think realistictly. The mechanics of making this business work might be quite different in NYC than Des Moines. I decided the first step is to look at how the bikeshare busines actually works in NYC. Then I will create a proposal for how it might work in Des Moines.

## Results of Analysis

### Trip Duration in August

The first graph (Checkout Time for Users) is a linear depiction of trip duration during the month of August. The top of the graph lists the hours and the bottom breaks down each hour into minutes. From the depiction we see that most rides are about 10 minutes in length and the most rides in NYC seem are under 30 minute. This may suggest that the bikeshare in Des Moines would be successful if the radius of the bikeshare territory would be within a 30-minute bike route.

### Trip Duration by Gender

A second graph (Trip Duration by Gender) further looks at trip duration by gender of riders. The vast majority (just under 110k) of riders are male compared to approximately 30k female users. Thre were just under 10k riders listed as gender not identified. NYC in 2020 has 5.3% females and Des Moines in that same year posted 50.9%.

### Trips by Weekday Each Hour

The next visualiation is a heatmap of trips by weekday for each hour (seen below). Monday through Friday shows that most usage of the bikeshare system was around 08:00AM and then again between 05:00PM to 06:00PM. This suggests that most users during the work week are using the bikeshare as transportation to their place of employment. On weekends the use was more steady with most use between 8am and 7pm on Saturdays and Sundays. 

#### Weekdays
From the above analysis, We can understand that much of the weekday bike usage arrives from commuters both going and coming home from work. With this knowledge we can get idea of what a bikeshare program would look like in Des Moines based on how many users we can expect to use the bikeshare for commuting in Des Moines. 

#### Weekends
Steady usage on the weekends from 8am to 7pm may come from tourist andor riders riding errands on weekends. A further look at usership on the weekends specifically; subscribers vs non subscribers and stopping and starting points could give us further insight to the whose using the bikes on weekends. Is it fueled by tourist or locales running errands, or going to weekend work?

### Trips by Gender (Each Week Day Hour and a by Hour) 2 Visualizations

In NYC the Citbike program gives riders the opportunity to subscribe to the bikeshare program. The next two heatmap visualizations (Trips by Gender by Hour and Trips by Gender Weekday) show the breakdown of those who subscribed versus casual customer, the day of the week, and their gender. The majority of those who use the bikeshare are males subscribers. Success in Des Moines would depend heavily upon male subscribers who use the bikeshare often.

### Trip Usage by Hour in August

The below filled line chart shows usage by hour in August and once agian highlights the commute times as highest usage times. With the other insights we can see that the bikeshare programs success on weekdays will depend on male subscribers who use the bikeshare for commutes on weekdays.

### Starting and Stopping Points (2 Visualizations)

The two visualizations below show starting and stopping points of rides. Some areas along the river in Brookklyn also have higher concentrations of bikeshare usage then the rest of the city. It's worth noting that even in Manhatten with a high concentration of people per square mile most of Manhatten's use of the bikeshare comes from lower Manhatten where people pr square mile is highest and where most visitors would frequent. For reference Des Moines has 2,428.4 people per square mile vs NYC's density at 29,303.2 which is a significant difference.

## Summary
### Major conclusions

1- The majority of those who use the bikeshare are males subscribers. Des Moine success will depend greatly on the amount of frquent users who sign up for program.

2- The bikeshare programs success on weekdays in Des Mones will depend on subscribers who use the bikeshare for commutes (both male and female, but primarily male)

3- Weekend usage needs to be researched further, but at this point it appears to be either tourist or weekend errand running. Weekend usage is steady in NYC and needs to be conted on in DEs Moines for success of a program there.

4- The downtown area of Des Moines will be key area for success of bike program in Des Moines. High density of people leads to success of program at least in the case of NYC. In lower Manhatten which has highest desity of people per sqaure mile, sees the most usag of the bike program. In Brooklyn (36,732 people per suare mile) or Queens (20,847) where density is less then lower Manhatten, ridership geatly declines. The densisty of those areas is still much higher than in Des Moines. The downtown area of Des Moines will be key area for success of bike program in Des Moines.

###  More Analysis

1- A look at profitabilty of the NYC bikeshare program would be needed. Profit per ride? Which rides are most profitable? When is most profit made? Profit from subscribers vs less frequent customers

2- Whose is using the bikes on weekends in NYC. Tourist? What percentage?

3- Analysis of the key factors from above for Des Moines. Density of downtown? Tourist traffic? Weather compared to NYC?
