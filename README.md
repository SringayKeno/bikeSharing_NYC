## Overview of Analysis 

Last summer, my friend Kate and I took the vacation of a lifetime. We spent 2 full weeks in New York City exploring historical landmarks like Central Park, the Empire State Building, and the Statue of Liberty. It was a magical experience. As we flew home we looking through photos and realized a key ingredient to the magic was an unlikely suspect, Citibike. Kate and I biked everywhere which allowed us to get to really know New York City and interact with others as they commuted on rideshare bikes.

A gem of an idea stated to form in our minds. What if we could start a similar bikeshare in Des Moines Iowa, our hometown? Kate and I start brainstorming, and a to of weeks later, Kate calls telling me she may have a potential angel investor. The potential investoris interested in providing seed money to explore a bikesharing program in Des Moines. This is an exciting prospect, but I know we have to think realistictly. The mechanics of making this business work might be quite different in NYC than Des Moines. I decided the first step is to look at how the bikeshare busines actually works in NYC. Then I will create a proposal for how it might work in Des Moines.

## Results of Analysis

### Trip Duration in August

The first graph (Checkout Time for Users) is a linear depiction of trip duration during the month of August. The top of the graph lists the hours and the bottom breaks down each hour into minutes. From the depiction we see that most rides are about 10 minutes in length and the most rides in NYC seem are under 30 minute. This may suggest that the bikeshare in Des Moines would be successful if the radius of the bikeshare territory would be within a 30-minute bike route.

### Trip Duration by Gender

A second graph (Trip Duration by Gender) further looks at trip duration by gender of riders. The vast majority (just under 110k) of riders are male compared to approximately 30k female users. Thre were just under 10k riders listed as gender not identified. NYC in 2020 has 5.3% females and Des Moines in that same year posted 50.9%.

### Trips by Weekday Each Hour

The next visualiation is a heatmap of trips by weekday for each hour (seen below). Monday through Friday shows that most usage of the bikeshare system was around 08:00AM and then again between 05:00PM to 06:00PM. This suggests that most users during the work week are using the bikeshare as transportation to their place of employment. On weekends the use was more steady with most use between 8am and 7pm on Saturdays and Sundays. 

#### Weekdays
From the above analysis, We can understand that much of the weekday bike usage arrives from commuters both going and coming home from work. With this knowledge we can get idea of what a bikeshare program would look like in Des Moines based on how many users we can expect to use the bikeshare for commuting in Des Moines. 

#### Weekends
Steady usage on the weekends from 8am to 7pm may come from tourist andor riders riding errands on weekends. A further look at usership on the weekends specifically; subscribers vs non subscribers and stopping and starting points could give us further insight to the whose using the bikes on weekends. Is it fueled by tourist or locales running errands, or going to weekend work?

### Trips by Gender (Each Week Day Hour)

In bikeshare in NYC, people are given the option to subscribe to the system. This visualization shows the breakdown of those who subscribed versus casual customer, and their gender. The majority of those who use the bikeshare are males subscribers. Success in Des Moines would depend heavily upon male subscribers who use the bikeshare often.
